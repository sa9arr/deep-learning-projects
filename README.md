A repository for sharing my deep learning projects while I learn it.
1. Handwritten Digits Classifier
It turns out to be the "hello world" project of deep learning series. I have used MNIST dataset of handwritten digits that contains 60,000 handwritten digits for training the model and 10,000 for testing the model with each digit stored in a grayscale image with a size of 28x28 pixels. The model is first trained with simple neural network implementation with no hidden layers to classify the handwritten digits and then added hidden layers to improve the performance.

3. Customer Churn Prediction
